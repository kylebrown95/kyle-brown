<h2>Ethics essay</h2>

<div class="document">
  <p>When I was working on general assignment at the Missourian, I was sent out to talk to a local high schooler about his Eagle Scout project collecting worn U.S. flags for proper disposal. I met the boy, Joshua Arri, at a coffee shop and interviewed him for what I thought would be a quick nuts-and-bolts type of story. However, he disclosed a lot more information about his personal struggles and setbacks than I had originally bargained for. He got into some deep territory talking about his recent medical history and struggles with mental health and how he had to stage a major recovery to become an Eagle Scout. Because of the extraordinary nature of his resilience, I called the newsroom and got permission to take some more time to explore his story.
  </p>
  <p>I met with Arri again, this time with his parents, and I got more details about his medical history. From talking to the Arri family I confirmed that he had a chiari malformation — a condition in which tissue from the cerebellum protrudes down into the opening at the base of the skull — and a benign pituitary tumor concurrently, but they had both resolved without any medical intervention. The family was strong in faith, and they told me they believed it was all thanks to prayer. “It's truly a miracle when you look at it," Arri said. His mother, Shelley Arri, felt the same. “We prayed," she said. "And not everybody that you pray over gets healed, but there was no other explanation. God just healed him.” When I gave my beat editor, Katherine Reed, the rundown of what I found out so far, she told me I would need to back everything up with Arri’s doctor, and there were no issues there; everything the doctor told me was consistent with the information I already had.
  </p>
  <p>When it came time to write the story, however, I didn’t have an explanation for Arri’s healing aside from prayer. As touching and powerful as it sounded, I needed some facts to explain this phenomenon without completely stepping on the Arri family’s beliefs. For one, I do not believe in miracles, so printing that wouldn’t have been consistent with my beliefs, and second, I owed readers an accurate and fact-based portrayal of what might have actually happened.
  </p>
  <p>Accuracy and truth-telling are at the foundation of all journalistic codes of ethics, and at the core of journalism as an institution. I felt it would have been inaccurate and untrue to say to readers that Joshua Arri’s medical condition was healed miraculously as a result of prayer when there most likely was an evidence-based explanation available. Walter Williams’ specific wording in the Journalist’s Creed certainly applies to the situation I faced: “I believe that a journalist should write only what he holds in his heart to be true.” The Poynter Institute’s Guiding Principles for the Journalist advises to “Seek truth and report it as fully as possible.” And for good measure, the American Society of Newspaper Editors lists “Truth and Accuracy” as one of its principles. According to the ASNE Statement of Principles, “Every effort must be made to assure that the news content is accurate, free from bias and in context, and that all sides are presented fairly.”
  </p>
  <p>My first instinct when facing this situation was that I needed more information. I had not thought to ask anyone else about this pursuit; after all, I doubted anyone would complain about additional research. If anything, I thought, including as much pertinent information as possible to explain Arri’s sudden recovery could only strengthen my story in the end. My solution for balancing the Arris’ faith-based account was twofold: Corroborate the Arri family’s claims with research articles documenting chiari malformations and pituitary tumors disappearing on their own and find medical explanations for why they might resolve without intervention. As I suspected, Arri was not the first person to have a self-resolving chiari malformation (a similar case was documented in a Russian man), and there was an accepted reason for why they might self-resolve in pediatric cases such as Arri’s. And I was able to find an explanation for how a tumor might vanish, too.
  </p>
  <p>Really this story was about Joshua Arri’s resilience and his family’s support to help him get his Eagle Scout certification in time for his 18th birthday; therefore, the Arri family were the main stakeholders. I felt it would have been disparaging to them and incomplete to leave out any mention of their faith through a difficult time of recovery. And I could tell from talking to them how important their religious beliefs were in their daily lives. So when I wrote my story I made sure I didn’t harm them in any way and that my inclusion of medical evidence did not undermine any statement of faith or proclamation of a miracle, because their understanding of everything was just as vital to the story.
  </p>
  <p>If I was going to handle this situation again, there are a few alternative approaches I could have taken. To start, I could have left out any mention of Arri’s past medical conditions and instead write a straightforward news story about his project and his motivations for doing it. I also could have chosen to give less weight in the story to Arri’s medical condition overall — going in less depth might have allowed me to leave the Arris’ statements on prayer alone without much need for additional explanation. And, finally, I could have omitted any mention of prayer or God whatsoever, but I think that would be unfair and inaccurate to the Arris’ experience through their ordeal.
  </p>
  <p>One thing I did not actively do in my decision-making process was consult anyone else, so if I did decide to take the feature-length story approach again, talking to an editor and seeking advice for how to handle these types of religious claims could have helped me. Reflecting on everything, for me to build on this experience, it would be prudent for me to talk with my peers more about the dilemmas I encounter, and about my decision-making processes in general.
  </p>
  <p>Overall, the biggest lesson I took away from this situation was that there is no such thing as too much information to support what’s being said in a story. I chose to err on the side of caution in my reporting and found an explanation for every medical phenomenon that had occurred, and I believe it made my story stronger on a fact-based level. Being thorough and providing compelling research should always be the goal in good journalism, but my personal struggle was to balance it in a way that would not bring in too much opinion and outright discount a good family’s religious beliefs. Contrary to my fears, I received no complaints from Arri or his family; maybe I had nothing to worry about in the first place (I was actually invited to attend his ceremony a few months later, so he must have been satisfied with my work). Journalism has always been about accuracy and telling the truth, and sticking to that principle through this scenario has galvanized my belief in its power.
